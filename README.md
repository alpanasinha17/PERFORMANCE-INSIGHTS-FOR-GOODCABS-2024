This repository includes the code, datasets, and insights from my analysis for **Performance Insights for Goodcabs 2024**  

**Problem Statement**
Goodcabs, a cab service focusing on Tier -2 cities in India, has been in operation for 2 years and supports local drivers while providing excellent service to passengers. The company aims to achieve ambitious 2024 targets by analyzing its performance on key metrics like trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rates, and the balance between new and repeat passengers.
The Chief Operations, Bruce Haryali, urgently needs insights on these metrics. However, the analytics manager, Tony is busy with another project and assigned this task to Peter Pandey, a curious data analyst. Peter will prepare the insights using notes provided by Tony, as these findings will directly impact decision - making the leadership level.

**TASK**
My task is to analyze Goodcabs performance metrics, identify key insights, and provide actionable recommendations to help the company meet its 2024 goals for growth and passenger satisfaction.

Business Request -2: Monthly City-Level Trips Target Performance Report

Generate a report that evaluates the target performance for trips at the monthly and city level. For each city and month, compare the actual total trips with the target trips and categorise the performance as follows:

• If actual trips are greater than target trips, mark it as "Above Target".
• If actual trips are less than or equal to target trips, mark it as "Below Target".

Additionally, calculate the % difference between actual and target trips to quantify the performance gap.

Fields:

• City_name
• month name
• actual_trips
• target_trips
• performance_status
• % difference
